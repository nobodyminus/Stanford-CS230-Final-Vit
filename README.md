# Stanford-CS230-Final-Vit
Stanford CS230 final project
This repository is for my CS230 final project, and is based on (but not forked off of) https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch. Train is for local training. prod_train is for training in AWS. The models folder hold both the ViT model and the various attentions used with it.
